### Sprint Forecast
**Forecasted Point Completion:** 39 Points

>(02/06/2023) The point schema will follow a 1:1 ratio such that 1 point is equivalent to 1 day of development effort and so forth. Any stories above 5 total points would be broken down into smaller more subsequent stories. We believe that 39 points will be necessary to complete the basic frontend, backend, and login authentication services.

**Points Completed:** 22.5 Points

>(03/15/2023) While our development did not reach the 39 point total, we have still achieved our goals of creating a basic frontend and backend service as well as login authentication. We have also established the groundwork for other functionalities and pages within the application. We believe that our point totals did not match our original estimate as some stories were removed from the sprint due to redundancy, being out-of-scope, or unnecessary for the final product.
